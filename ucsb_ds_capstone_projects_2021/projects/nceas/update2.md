**Progress**
- Began coworking hours on Fridays in addition to our weekly meeting on Mondays so we can have another opportunity to collaborate and share ideas.
- Workflow of creating R package (documentation, license, github, function ) through the say_aloha (insert link)
- 
- We each created 3 demo packages, 2 with data provided for us, and one where we had to choose our own data source from any give LTER site. 
- incorporate what we learned in past weeks (github workflow, tidyverse, metajam)  putting them together
- Analyzed a couple datasets from sites we are intested in.
- Large stress on creating vignettes.
- We began presenting our vignettes and demo packages during our weekly meetings as another form of a progress update.
