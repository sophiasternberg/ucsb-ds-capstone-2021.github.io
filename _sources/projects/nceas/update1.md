Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Datasets: R package

sponsor: National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)

building an R package (and accompanying website) that contains one sample dataset from each of the 28 LTER Network sites, for use in (environmental) data science education


In the past month, we

- using Gitter for team communication, a chat interface that goes with github repos

- each of us reviewed several LTER sites, 
the LTER Network contaisns hundreds of research projects and thousands of interesting real-world environmental datasets

- will be using git, Github, and Rstudio for project management and collaboration
- each of us have different level of experience in these tools
- our sponsors, Julien and Allison, did a mini lesson, 
- learned the workflow we will be using
- we partnered up and practiced (creating Rproj, branches, pull, push, code review, merge, etc)
- used tidyverse package for data wrangling and visualization for data from the palmerpenguins package
- plot relationship penguin body mass versus flipper length 
- plot bill depth versus bill length for Adelie penguins


-LTER datasets are archived in a centralized data repository managed by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)
- introduced to metajam R package, used for downloading metadata
- explored the adelie pengins more
- Adelie penguin chick production across years and islands
