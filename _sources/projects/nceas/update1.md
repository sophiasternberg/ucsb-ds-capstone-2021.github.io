**National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Datasets: R package**

Goal: 
 Build an R package (and accompanying website) that contains one sample dataset from each of the 28 LTER Network sites, for use in (environmental) data science education as an alternative to the popular Iris dataset. 

LTER datasets are archived in a centralized data repository managed by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI).


In the past month, we have:

- Used Gitter for team communication, a chat interface that is linked with Github repositories
- Reviewed several LTER sites, each of which contains hundreds of research projects and thousands of interesting real-world environmental datasets
- Used Git, Github, and RStudio for project management and collaboration (each of us have different levels of experience with these tools)
- Learned the workflow we will be using from our sponsors, Julien and Allison, who gave us a mini lesson
- Partnered up with each other and practiced the workflow (creating RMarkdown documents, branches, pulls, pushes, code reviews, merges, etc)
- Used the tidyverse package for data wrangling and visualization for data from the palmerpenguins package
- Plotted the relationship between penguin body mass and flipper length 
- Plotted bill depth versus bill length for Adelie penguins
- Been introduced to the metajam R package, which is used for downloading metadata
- Explored the Adelie penguins data and plotted Adelie penguin chick production across years and islands
